# CS673-HealthcommunicationPortal

Patients love your free portal- it lets them conveniently and securely communicate with you and access their records anytime and anywhere. Our patient portal is fully integrated with EHR saving your staffâ€™s phone time and minimizes distractions as lab results sharing, prescription refill requests, and appointment requests can be handled from within the EHR.

## About The Project
  
  Data Architecture
  -----------------
  Every product collects some data that is stored inside a database in the form of facts and dimensions and also involves transactional data of day to day life. In this product,
  we are mainly concentrating in the data collected by the hospital and the patients who cannot arrive at the hospital and portray a user friendly portal that describes the
  medical ailment involved and their daily health proceedings with correct medicines as suggested by the Doctor in the prescription. Everything is stored in Heroku cloud and 
  the data will be fetched using PostgreSQL.
