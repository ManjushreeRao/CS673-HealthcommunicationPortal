Patients love your free portal- it lets them conveniently and securely communicate with you and access their records anytime and anywhere. Our patient portal is fully integrated with EHR saving your staffâ€™s phone time and minimizes distractions as lab results sharing, prescription refill requests, and appointment requests can be handled from within the EHR.
